## View the full site (with CSS, sidebar, and JavaScript)

**Always open one of these with Live Server — not files inside `sections/`:**

1. **Right-click `index.html`** (in the project root) → **Open with Live Server**  
   - Opens the full site and redirects to the dashboard.

2. **Or right-click `dashboard.html`** (in the project root) → **Open with Live Server**  
   - Opens the full dashboard with sidebar, styles, and scripts.

If you open a file inside **`sections/`** (e.g. `sections/dashboard.html`) with Live Server, you will only see plain text with no layout or CSS — those files are content fragments loaded by the main dashboard, not full pages.

### Quick start

- Open **`index.html`** or **`dashboard.html`** with Live Server to see the complete site.
